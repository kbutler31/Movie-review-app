title: 'Forrest Gump'
year:1994
Synopsis: Slow-witted Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) has never thought of himself as disadvantaged, and thanks to his supportive mother (Sally Field), he leads anything but a restricted life. Whether dominating on the gridiron as a college football star, fighting in Vietnam or captaining a shrimp boat, Forrest inspires people with his childlike optimism. But one person Forrest cares about most may be the most difficult to save -- his childhood love, the sweet but troubled Jenny (Robin Wright).

        review:"Low score on Rotten Tomatoes... What do they expect from this movie? It's a family comedy to pass the time, and it has several funny moments, I don't know what else it has to have for the critics to be satisfied. It is a simple but entertaining movie where a beautiful and funny dog appears, plus Tom Hanks in his comic side, a duo that in itself is worth seeing. I recommend this movie, it delivers what it promises."

        review:"It is so funny and cool must watch. It reminded me of the time I ate gummy bears and I felt sorry for the bear because bears are kind of like dogs and I spit it out and gave it to my son because he doesn't care about the gummy bears he is kind of careless but I tried to tell him that he needed to train the gummy bears but he wouldn't listen to me even though before I left I gave him a note that told him every thing to do with the gummy bear but he did not care for the gummy bear and when I looked over him I felt like I raised a disgrace he doesn't even like his job and his job is also to be a cop I said just train the gummy bear and bring it to work but 3 days later he didn't care and looked at the gummy bear suspiciously and ate it my whole life was completely ruined I cried for ages and now I am the parent that lives in my sons basement".

title: 'Green Mile'
year: 1999
Synopsis: Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks) walked the mile with a variety of cons. He had never encountered someone like John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), a massive black man convicted of brutally killing a pair of young sisters. Coffey had the size and strength to kill anyone, but not the demeanor. Beyond his simple, naive nature and a deathly fear of the dark, Coffey seemed to possess a prodigious, supernatural gift. Paul began to question whether Coffey was truly guilty of murdering the two girls.
